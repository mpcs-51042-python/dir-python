These are special functions that return the **generator type**.\n\nNote that this is the same *type* as the generators we've already introduced, just a different way to create them.\n\nA function that contains the `yield` keyword, is automatically a generator function.\nLet's rewrite one of our earlier examples as a function:\n\n```{python}\ndef powers_of_2(limit):\n    for n in range(limit):\n        yield 2**n\n```\n\nCalling this function returns a generator:\n\n```{python}\np2g = powers_of_2(10)\nprint(p2g)\nprint(type(p2g))\n```\n\nWe can iterate over it with a for loop:\n\n```{python}\nfor x in p2g:\n    print(x)\n```\n\nAll generators can only be consumed once, so an attempt to call `next()` leads to an error:\n\n```{python}\ntry:\n    print(next(p2g))\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(repr(e))\n```\n\nGenerator functions do give us an option that expressions did not, we can create a fresh generator by calling the function again:\n\n```{python}\ng1 = powers_of_2(10)\ng2 = powers_of_2(10)\n\n# g1 and g2 are independent, we can move one forward,\n# and it doesn't affect the other\n\nprint(\" g1\", next(g1))\nprint(\" g1\", next(g1))\nprint(\" g1\", next(g1))\nprint(\" g2\", next(g2))\nprint(\" g2\", next(g2))\nprint(\" g1\", next(g1))\n```\n\nGenerator functions can contain multiple `yield`, each `yield` **pauses** execution of the generator.\nThe internal state of the function remains intact, unlike **return**.\n\n```{python}\ndef simple_generator_func():\n    print(\"start\")\n    yield 1\n    print(\"still running\")\n    yield 2\n    print(\"one more\")\n    yield 3\n```\n\n```{python}\ng = simple_generator_func()\n\nprint(\"got (first)\", next(g))\n\nprint(\"--before loop--\")\n\nfor x in g:\n    print(\"got\", x)\n```\n\n### Infinite Generators\n\nGenerators do not need to ever actually exit, let's create an abstraction for our powers-of-n generators:\n\n```{python}\ndef powers_of_n(n):\n    i = 0\n    while True:\n        yield n ** i\n        i += 1\n```\n\n```{python}\npow5 = powers_of_n(5)\n\nprint(next(pow5))\nprint(next(pow5))\nprint(next(pow5))\nprint(next(pow5))\nprint(next(pow5))\n```\n\nThis code works because we're only asking for one more iteration of the loop, each time we call `next` the code in the function\nruns until it hits the next `yield`.\n\nWe can also use this in a loop *if we're careful to break!*:\n\n```{python}\nfor x in powers_of_n(7):\n    print(x)\n    # it is up to the calling loop to break, without this we run forever!\n    if x > 10000:\n        break \n```\n\n## Discussion: Benefits of Generators\n\n### Exercise: Write your own `range`\n\n```{python}\n# there is a third optional parameter to range, the *step*\nfor x in range(3, 10, 2):\n    print(x)\n```\n\n```python\ndef new_range(lower_bound, upper_bound, step=1):\n    pass\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## `range` revisited\n\nWhat does `range` return?\n\n```python\n# Tip: you can separate digits with _ for readability (Python ignores the _)\nfor i in range(1_000_000_000):\n    print(i)\n    if i == 3:\n        break\n```\n\nWe can see that it is *iterable*, perhaps a list or tuple?\n\nHow much memory does a list of 1 billion integers take?\n\n(4 bytes/int) * 1B = 4GB of RAM?!\n\nKeep in mind, we're only using one of these integers at a time!\n\nThis wasteful behavior was indeed the case in Python 2, `range` had to allocate all of the needed memory at once.\n\n*Fortunately in Python 3, a range is lazily-evaluated, but how?*\n\n```{python}\nrg = range(1000)\nprint(rg, type(rg))\n```\n\n## Generators\n\nGenerators are a special type of object that is *iterable*, but **not a collection**.\n\nA generator object *yields* a single result at a time, which means we can use far less memory in most cases, especially when we won't use the entire iterable.\n\nToday we'll see two ways to write generators: **generator functions**, and **generator expressions**.\n\n## Generator Expressions\n\nWhen we introduced *comprehensions* we mentioned that they only made sense to use if you are planning to use the entire iterable.\n\n```{python}\n# this allocates a list of 100 integers\npowers_of_two = [2**x for x in range(100)]\n\n# this is a wasteful way to use a list comprehension, only one value is needed at a time\nfor num in powers_of_two:\n    print(num)\n    if num > 1_000_000:\n        break\n```\n\nThere is one more expression that uses the comprehension-style syntax, and that is the **generator expression**.\n\n```{python}\n# parenthesis () instead of square brackets [], creates a generator expression\npowers_of_two_gen = (2**x for x in range(100))\n\n# what is this type?\nprint(powers_of_two_gen)\nprint(type(powers_of_two_gen))\n\n# iteration works as you'd expect\nfor num in powers_of_two_gen:\n    print(num)\n    if num > 1_000_000:\n        break\n```\n\nThe generator expression creates a **generator** object, which, like `range`, is iterable, but not a collection.\n\n### Iteration Revisited\n\nIteration in Python is achieved via a *protocol*, one or more special methods that describe how a given type\ncan be used in a certain context.\n\nWe'll explore these protocols in more detail later in the course.\n\nIteration depends on two functions: `iter()` and `next()`.\n\n`iter()` takes an *iterable* and returns an *iterator*, a kind of object we usually don't interact with directly.\n\nAny *iterable* can be passed into `next()`, which will return the next value, or raise a `StopIteration` error if the iterable is exhausted.\n\n\n```python\nfor i in iterable:\n    print(i)\n\n# can be rewritten as\niterator = iter(iterable)\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        i = next(iterator)\n        print(i)\n    except StopIteration:\n        #

contains the `yield` keyword, is automatically a generator function.\nLet's rewrite one of our earlier examples as a function:\n\n```{python}\ndef powers_of_2(limit):\n    for n in range(limit):\n        yield 2**n\n```\n\nCalling this function returns a generator:\n\n```{python}\np2g = powers_of_2(10)\nprint(p2g)\nprint(type(p2g))\n```\n\nWe can iterate over it with a for loop:\n\n```{python}\nfor x in p2g:\n    print(x)\n```\n\nAll generators can only be consumed once, so an attempt to call `next()` leads to an error:\n\n```{python}\ntry:\n    print(next(p2g))\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(repr(e))\n```\n\nGenerator functions do give us an option that expressions did not, we can create a fresh generator by calling the function again:\n\n```{python}\ng1 = powers_of_2(10)\ng2 = powers_of_2(10)\n\n# g1 and g2 are independent, we can move one forward,\n# and it doesn't affect the other\n\nprint(\" g1\", next(g1))\nprint(\" g1\", next(g1))\nprint(\" g1\", next(g1))\nprint(\" g2\", next(g2))\nprint(\" g2\", next(g2))\nprint(\" g1\", next(g1))\n```\n\nGenerator functions can contain multiple `yield`, each `yield` **pauses** execution of the generator.\nThe internal state of the function remains intact, unlike **return**.\n\n```{python}\ndef simple_generator_func():\n    print(\"start\")\n    yield 1\n    print(\"still running\")\n    yield 2\n    print(\"one more\")\n    yield 3\n```\n\n```{python}\ng = simple_generator_func()\n\nprint(\"got (first)\", next(g))\n\nprint(\"--before loop--\")\n\nfor x in g:\n    print(\"got\", x)\n```\n\n### Infinite Generators\n\nGenerators do not need to ever actually exit, let's create an abstraction for our powers-of-n generators:\n\n```{python}\ndef powers_of_n(n):\n    i = 0\n    while True:\n        yield n ** i\n        i += 1\n```\n\n```{python}\npow5 = powers_of_n(5)\n\nprint(next(pow5))\nprint(next(pow5))\nprint(next(pow5))\nprint(next(pow5))\nprint(next(pow5))\n```\n\nThis code works because we're only asking for one more iteration of the loop, each time we call `next` the code in the function\nruns until it hits the next `yield`.\n\nWe can also use this in a loop *if we're careful to break!*:\n\n```{python}\nfor x in powers_of_n(7):\n    print(x)\n    # it is up to the calling loop to break, without this we run forever!\n    if x > 10000:\n        break \n```\n\n## Discussion: Benefits of Generators\n\n### Exercise: Write your own `range`\n\n```{python}\n# there is a third optional parameter to range, the *step*\nfor x in range(3, 10, 2):\n
