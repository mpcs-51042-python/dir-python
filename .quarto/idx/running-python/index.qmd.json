{"title":"Running Python","markdown":{"headingText":"Running Python","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nOne of the defining characteristics of Python is that it is an **interpreted** language.\nIf you've used a language like Java or C you're used to having to compile your code.\nPython is instead typically translated to an intermediate representation (bytecode) and immediately executed without a separate compilation step.\n\nTo do this, we need a Python interpreter, a program called `python` (sometimes `python3`).\n\nThere are a lot of ways to install Python, but for this class we'll use a tool called `uv` to manage Python and various dependencies.\n\n## Installing uv\n\n\n1. Go to this page, and follow the instructions for your environment: [installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).\n2. Once uv is installed, type `uv python install 3.13` in your terminal.\n3. After Python is installed, verify the version with `uv run python -V`.\n   You should see a version that starts with 3.13.\n\n## The Python REPL\n\nOne of the benefits of an interpreted language is that it is possible to run it one line at a time, in an interactive session.\n\n`uv run python`\n\nThis feature of most interpreted languages is called a REPL (pronounced rep-el).\n\nREPL stands for:\n\n- Read - takes user input, typically one line at a time\n- Evaluate - evaluate user input, running the code in the current context\n- Print - print the output of the evaluation automatically (without the need for a `print()`)\n- Loop - repeat, until the user quits\n\nThis is incredibly useful, many Python programmers keep a REPL open at all times, to try out ideas / test things / look up documentation.\n\n## Exercise: python-demos directory\n\nLet's set up a small local Python project using `uv` so that we can try a different REPL and run some code together.\n\n1. Open a terminal and navigate (using `cd`) to a location where you'd like to create our demo repository.\n2. Make a new directory (`mkdir python-demos`) and then enter it (`cd python-demos`).\n3. Initialize the directory as a `uv` project with `uv init`.\n\n  This will create a `pyproject.toml` and some other files that aren't needed for our purposes.\n\n  `pyproject.toml` exists at the root of a Python project and configures what other packages are needed.\n\n4. Let's install a package with `uv`, run `uv add ipython`\n\n  This will update your `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files and install the package for use from within this directory.\n\n5. To use this new package you can type `uv run ipython` from within the `python-demos` directory, and you will see `ipython`.\n\nWe'll talk more about package management and what this tool is doing later in the course.\n\n## `ipython` vs `python`\n\n`ipython` is an enhanced REPL for Python. It is using the same version of Python you already installed, but providing a different **interface**.\n\nIt provides command history, syntax highlighting, and a handful of other useful features that make it many people's preferred REPL.\nIt is up to you which you prefer, both provide access to the same core language.\n\nYou will often see interactive Python prompts shown as:\n\n```\n>>> x = 4 * 3\n>>> print(x)\n12  \n```\n\nThe lines that begin with `>>>` are the Python prompt, and lines without `>>>` indicating output.\n\nIn `ipython` input/output lines are marked with `In[0]` and `Out[0]` prefixes, but when showing interactive output I will stick to convention and use `>>>`.\n\n## Tip: Don't use pip (or conda)\n\nYou will see instructions using tools other than `uv`, but it is best to stick to a single tool.\n\nWhen you are looking at Python libraries, which we'll discuss later, you will often see instructions which state you should run `pip install foo`.\n\n**When you see `pip install foo` you should use `uv add foo` instead.**\n\n`conda install` instructions can usually be translated to `uv add` as well.\n\nThese tools are older than `uv` and can easily leave your system in a broken state, where `uv` restricts installs to the directory you are working in.\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["include-code-files"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
