h():\n    x = 3\n    def g():\n        print(x)\n    \n```\n\nThe above code has three different variables named x, each independent from one another.\n\nTo determine which name `print(x)` is referring to, we have to understand **scope**.\n\n**Scope** in Python is determined by the location of an assignment, or presence in a parameter list.\n\nWe've dealt with two types of scope so far:\n\n- module scope (Global)\n- function scope (Local)\n\nAnything declared inside of a function, including its parameter names, are considered *local to that function*.\n\n\nAssignment statements create or change local names by default.\n\nThe scope can be\n\n- Local: Scope of the current function.\n- Enclosing: Scope of any enclosing functions.\n- Global (sometimes called Module): Scope of the file.\n- Built-in: Built-ins.\n\n**LEGB**\n\nIf the name is not found after this search, an exception is raised.\n\n## Local vs. Global\n\nLocal scope refers to variables in the current function, global/module scope refers to anything at the top-level of a file:\n\n```{python}\n# demo.py\n\nx = 10000     # global scope\n\ndef f(x, y):\n    z = 3\n    print(\"locals=\", locals())\n    print(\"global names\", {k for k in globals() if k[0] != \"_\"})\n\nf(1, 2)\n```\n\nThe functions `locals()` and `globals()` can be used to view these for debugging purposes.\n\n### Modifying a global variable within a function\n\nIt is possible for a function to modify a global mutable:\n\n```{python}\nd = {\"key\": 123}\n\ndef f():\n    d[\"key\"] = 456\n\nf()\n\n# changes to d persist outside function, mutability!\nprint(d)\n```\n\nDespite being possible, this is generally a **bad idea**, mutability is why using globals makes programs hard to follow.\n\nWhat if we instead try to change an immutable via **reassignment**?\n\n```{python}\ns = \"hello \"\n\ndef f():\n    s += \" world!\"   # attempt to both use & reassign s\n\ntry:\n    f()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(repr(e))\n```\n\n### `global`\n\nVery very occasionally, we want to allow for this:\n\n```{python}\ns = \"hello \"\n\ndef f():\n    # indicates that the name s within the function refers to the global s\n    global s\n    s += \" world!\"   # attempt to both use & reassign s\n\ntry:\n    f()\n    print(\"s after function:\", s)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(repr(e))\n```\n\nThis is a **bad idea** for the same reason that modifying the mutable was, tracking changes to global state makes it very hard to reason about functions.\n\n```python\n# this seems like a reasonably safe use of globals\nNUM_ENTRIES = 1000\nSECRET_KEY = \"1899232-32kldfj3\"\nIGNORED_KEYS = [\"middle_name\", \"old_badge_num\"]\n\n# looking at this code, one assumes that it'd be possible to reorder/parallelize\n# clean_data_part1 and part2, but if the author of these functions for some\n# reason used `global`, or modifies the list IGNORED_KEYS, there are hard-to-observe\n# actions that can lead to subtle bugs\ndata = read_data()\ndata = clean_data_part1(data)\ndata = clean_data_part2(data)\npublish_data(data)\n```\n\n## `builtins`\n\nBuilt-in scope is above global scope, if a variable does not exist at the global/module level, a final scope is searched.\n\nWhen you use functions like `print()`, `dict()`, or `map()`, those are from the builtin scope:\n\n```{python}\nfor name in dir(__builtins__):\n    if name[0].islower():\n        print(name)\n```\n\n## Enclosing Scope\n\nRemember, our scope lookup order is LEGB: local, **enclosing**, global, built-in.\n\nEnclosing scope exists when we have nested functions:\n\n```{python}\n# here we see that f2 can access f1's y, and that there\n# are two distinct x variables, inside f1 and f2\ndef f1():\n    x = \"OUTER\"\n    y = \"from enclosing\"\n    def f2():\n        x = \"INNER\"\n        print(\"y=\", y)\n        print(\"inside f2 x=\", x)\n    print(\"inside f1 before f2 has been called x=\", x)\n    f2()\n    print(\"inside f1 after f2 has been called\", x)\n\nf1()\n```\n\n### Closures\n\nWhen a function is nested inside another function, future calls can continue to access the original enclosing scope.\n\nThe combination of a nested function and its enclosing scope is called a closure.\n\n```{python}\ndef make_func(n):\n    def f(x):\n        # n: locally scoped to make_func() < enclosing scope\n        # x: locally scoped to f()\n        # we are using the n from the enclosing scope\n        return x ** n \n    return f\n```\n\n```{python}\nto_the_third = make_func(3)\nto_the_third(10) # remembers the n from the enclosing scoped\n```\n\n```{python}\nsquared = make_func(2)\nsquared(10)  # has it's own distinct n from it's closure\n```\n\nWe can use this to create cache behavior:\n\n```{python}\nimport math\n\ndef make_cached_calc():\n    prior_calls = {}\n    \n    def calc(x, y):\n        # this portion only runs if we haven't seen x, y before\n        if (x, y) not in prior_calls:\n            print(f\"doing computation on {x} and {y}...\")\n            # do 'expensive' computation\n            answer = math.sin(x) + math.exp(y)\n            # save to cache\n            prior_calls[x, y] = answer\n\n        # always runs\n        print(\"cache=\", prior_calls)\n        # retrieve from cache, will be present by this point\n        return prior_calls[x, y]\n\n    # return function w/ enclosing scope of prior_calls    \n    return calc\n\n# obtain inner function\ndo_computation = make_cached_calc()\n```\n\n```{python}\ndo_computation(1, 2)\n```\n\n```{python}\ndo_computation(1, 2)\n```\n\n```{python}\ndo_computation(0.5, 0.7)\n```\n\n```{python}\n# has own enclosure\ndo_computation2 = make_cached_calc()\ndo_computation2(1, 2)\n```\n\n\n### `nonlocal`\n\nThere is also a `nonlocal`, which allows modifying a variable declared in **enclosing** scope.\n\nLike `global`, it is placed inside the **inner** function, allowing access to an enclosing variable (not vice-versa!).\n\n\n```python\ndef create_counter_func():\n    counter = 0\n    def f():\n        # gives us permission to access the enclosing counter\n        nonlocal counter\n        counter += 1\n        print(f\"called {counter} times\")\n    return f\n\ng = create_counter_func()\nh = create_counter_func()\n```\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```python\nx
