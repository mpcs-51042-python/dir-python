{"title":"Statements","markdown":{"headingText":"Statements","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nPython programs are made up of statements. **Expressions** are special types of statements that represent values.\n\nNow we'll look at statements related to **control flow**, deciding which lines of code will be executed next.\nWithout them our programs would just execute one line after the next with no exception.\n\n## Indentation\n\nPerhaps the most jarring change for C/Java/JavaScript programmers: Python does not use braces.\n\nInstead, indentation signifies code block boundaries.\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import braces\nSyntaxError: not a chance\n```\n\n## `if, elif, else` Statements\n\n```python\nif condition:\n    statement1\n    statement2\nelif condition:    # else if\n    statement3\nelse:\n    statement4\n    statement5\n```\n\n- Note the colon after each condition.\n- `elif` and `else` are optional\n- parenthesis around the expression are optional\n- each line should be indented four spaces\n\nThis is a statement because you don't write\n\n```\nx = if ...:\n        ...\n    else:\n        ...\n    else:\n        ...\n```\n\nInstead, these lines of code are evaluated conditionally.\n\n```{python}\n#| slideshow: {slide_type: subslide}\n#| tags: []\n# if example\n\nx = 100\n\nif x < 0:\n    print(\"negative\")\n    print(\"second line\")\nelif x == 0:\n    print(\"zero\")\nelif x == 4:\n    print(\"four\")\nelse:\n    print(\"positive\")\n```\n\n## `while` statement\n\n```python\nwhile condition:\n    statement1\n    statement2\n```\n\n```{python}\n#| scrolled: true\n#| slideshow: {slide_type: subslide}\n#| tags: []\ntime_left = 10\n\nwhile time_left != 0:\n    print(f\"{time_left}...\")\n    time_left -= 1\n\nprint(\"blast off!\") \n```\n\n## `for` statement\n\n```python\nfor var in iterable:\n    statement1\n    statement2\n```\n\nThis looks a bit different from C/Java.\n\nAlso, what is an iterable?\n\nFor now, just know that sequences are iterables, we'll cover iterables soon.\n\n```{python}\ncities = [\n    \"Tokyo\",\n    \"Delhi\",\n    \"Shanghai\",\n    \"São Paulo\",\n    \"Mexico City\",\n    \"Cairo\",\n    \"Mumbai\",\n    \"Beijing\",\n    \"Dhaka\",\n    \"Osaka\",\n]\n\nfor city in cities:\n    if city == \"Cairo\":\n        # we don't need to print Cairo out\n        break\n    print(city)\n\nseconds_left = 7\n```\n\n```{python}\nfor city in cities:\n    need_to_break = False\n    for letter in city:\n        if letter == \"y\":\n            need_to_break = True\n            break\n        print(letter)\n    if need_to_break:\n        break\n```\n\n### `break & continue`\n\nYou may have seen `break` and `continue` in other languages.\n\nIf so, they work the same way in Python.\n\n`break` - exit a loop immediately\n\n`continue` - immediately begin next iteration of loop\n\n`else` statement after `for` or `while` - executes only if no break was called\n\n```{python}\n# break/else demo\n\ntime_left = 10\nabort_at = 4\n\nwhile time_left > 0:\n    print(f\"{time_left}...\")\n    time_left -= 1\n    if time_left == abort_at:\n        print(\"Launch Aborted\")\n        break\nelse:\n    # this only runs if we don't break\n    print(\"blast off!\")\n```\n\n```{python}\ns = \"Hello class, my name is James\"\n\nfor ch in s:\n    if ch == \",\":\n        print(\"found a comma!\")\n        break\nelse:\n    print(\"no comma found!\")\n```\n\n```{python}\n# continue demo\n\nprint(cities)\nvisited = [\"Chicago\", \"Mexico City\", \"Shanghai\"]\n\nfor city in cities:\n    # this is not a great use, what would you do instead?\n    if city in visited:\n        continue\n    print(f\"I would like to visit {city}\")\n```\n\n`continue` is not used as often as `break` in practice, but can be useful if you want to skip part of a loop.\n\nGiven the somewhat less straightforward nature of a `continue`, a comment explaining your intent is a good idea.\n\n#### idiom: double-break with an inner boolean\n\n```{python}\nitems = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\nfound = False\n\n# we want to exit as soon as an e is found in *either* loop\nfor item in items:\n    for letter in item:\n        if letter == \"e\":\n            found = True\n            break\n        print(letter)\n    if found:\n        break\n```\n\n#### idiom: \"infinite\" loops\n\n```python\nwhile True:\n    do_something()\n    if condition:\n        break\n```\n\nSimilar to a `do while` loop in C/C++, where condition is checked after one iteration.\n\n### range\n\nAnother iterable!\n\n`range(stop)` # goes from 0 to (stop-1)\n\n`range(start, stop)` # goes from start to (stop-1)\n\nSame rules as slice, always **inclusive** of start, **exclusive** of stop.\n\n*or as you'd write mathematically:* ```[start, stop)```\n\n```{python}\nfor x in range(5, 25):\n    print(x)\n```\n\n```{python}\n# Note: we'll see a better way to do what this loop does below.\ns = \"hello\"\nfor i in range(len(s)):\n    print(i, s[i])\n```\n\n### `enumerate`\n\nAnother iterable, for when we need the index along with the object.\n\nGives us back two element tuples:\n\n`(index, element)`\n\n```{python}\nfor i, letter in enumerate(s):\n    if letter == \"w\":\n        print(i)\n```\n\n```{python}\n# same as above -- but less idiomatic & clear\nfor tup in enumerate(s):\n    if tup[1] == \"w\":\n        print(tup[0])\n```\n\n## Iteration\n\nA for loop can be described as iterating over an iterable:\n\n```\nfor var_name in iterable:\n    statement1\n    statement2\n    ...\n```\n\nAn **iterable** is any object that can be iterated over. All sequences are iterable, what else is?\n\n### range\n\nAnother iterable!\n\n`range(stop)` # goes from 0 to (stop-1)\n\n`range(start, stop)` # goes from start to (stop-1)\n\nSame rules as slice, always **inclusive** of start, **exclusive** of stop.\n\nor as you might write: ```[start, stop)``` -- we've seen this before with slicing\n\n```{python}\nfor x in range(12):\n    print(x)\n```\n\n```{python}\nfor x in range(8, 12):\n    print(x)\n```\n\n```{python}\nr = range(12)  # hmm?\nprint(type(r))\n```\n\n```{python}\n# a common pattern, but we'll see a better way with enumerate\ni = 0\nfor x in [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]:\n    print(i, x)\n    i += 1\n```\n\n### `enumerate`\n\nAnother function that returns an iterable, for when we need the index along with the object.\n\n`enumerate(original_iterable)` yields two element tuples: `(index, element)` for every item in the original.\n\n```{python}\n# \"incorrect\" example\n# find using range/len - as you might think to write it based on past experience\ndef find_r(s, letter_to_find):\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == letter_to_find:\n            return i\n    return -1\n```\n\n```{python}\nfind_r(\"Hello World\", \"W\")\n```\n\n```{python}\n# find using enumerate - Pythonic, more efficient\ndef find_e(s, letter_to_find):\n    for i, letter in enumerate(s):  # tuple unpacking\n        if letter == letter_to_find:\n            return i\n    return -1\n```\n\n```{python}\nfind_e(\"Hello world\", \"w\")\n```\n\n```{python}\nfind_r(\"Hello world\", \"?\")\n```\n\n```{python}\n# note: a built-in exists and should be used in practice\ns = \"Hello world\"\ns.find(\"w\")\n```\n\n### iterable unpacking\n\nWhen you know exactly how many elements are in an iterable, you can use this syntax to \"unpack\" them into variables:\n\n```{python}\ntup = (1, 2, 3)\nll = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n\nx, y, z = tup\nprint(x, y, z)\n```\n\n```{python}\n# idomatic swap using unpacking\nx = 7\ny = 8\nx, y = y, x\nprint(x, y)\n```\n\n## Functions\n\nA function is a set of statements that can be called more than once.\n\nBenefits of functions:\n\n- Encapsulation: package logic for use in multiple places\n- Allows programmer to avoid copy/paste to repeat same task, which helps maximize code reuse and minimize redundancy\n- Procedural decomposition: split our program into subtasks (i.e., functions) with separate roles.\n- Make life easier for debugging, testing, doing maintenance on code\n\n```python\ndef function_name(arg1: int, arg2: float, arg3: tuple) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Description of function task \n\n    Parameters: \n        arg1: description of arg1 \n        arg2: description of arg2\n        arg3: description of arg2\n\n    Returns:\n         Description of what this function returns, if anything.\n    \"\"\"\n    statement1\n    statement2\n    statement3\n    return value  # optional\n```\n\n### return\n\n- `return` may appear anywhere in a function body, including multiple times.\n\n- The first `return` encountered exits the function immediately.\n\n- Every function in python returns a value, `None` if not stated/reached.\n\n```{python}\ndef is_even(num):\n    return num % 2 == 0\n\nprint(is_even(3))\n```\n\n```{python}\n# what happens if return is missing?\ndef bad_return(num):\n    if num > 10000: \n        return False\n```\n\n```{python}\nprint(bad_return(1))\n```\n\n###  `pass` statement\n\nCan be used whenever you need to leave a block empty.  Usually temporarily.\n\n```python\nif x < 0:\n    pass # TODO: figure this out later\nelse:\n    return y / 2 - x\n\ndef implement_me():\n    pass\n```\n\n### Type Annotations\n\nType annotations are a newer Python feature.\nThey exist to provide hints as to what types a function takes.\n\nPython **does not enforce these**, think of them as documentation.\n\nYou will start seeing them in assignments and documentation, and we'll discuss them more later in the quarter.\n\n```{python}\n# I've broken this function into multiple lines, which is allowed\n# due to the parentheses.\n\ndef find_value(\n    a_list: list[list[str]],  # this parameter is a list of integers\n    num: int,                 # this parameter is a single integer\n) -> (\n    int | None\n):  # this annotation \"-> int | None\" indicates return type can be int or None\n    pass\n\ndef find_value(a_list: list[str], num: int) -> int | None:  \n    pass\n```\n\n```{python}\nx = find_value(3.0, \"hello\")\n```\n\n### docstrings\n\nFunction comments should be done in the form of a docstring, i.e., a multi-line string (delimited by triple quotes) after the function header.\n\nThis comment must contain information specific to what a function does. It should also include a description of the purpose and expected input arguments, the expected output values, and how error conditions are handled.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef hypotenuse(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves Pythagorean theorem a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n    for the value of c.\n\n    Parameters:\n      a, b: the lengths of sides of a right triangle.\n\n    Returns:\n      The length of the hypotenuse.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["include-code-files"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
